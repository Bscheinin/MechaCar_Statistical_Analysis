# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using R to analyze car manufacturing efficiencies

After each technical analysis provide a short summary of the results of the analysis


Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG ( add screenshot)
This analysis performed a multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes.

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? in order of influence spoiler angle, AWD and vehicle weight predictive of mpg
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? becausde there is a significant linear relationship between variables (listed above).
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? Because the intercept is so significant, would need to scale or transform the data to improve the predictive power of the model.
